# Vips

Programs that use `vips` don't manipulate images directly, instead they create pipelines of image processing operations building on a source image. When the end of the pipe is connected to a destination, the whole pipeline executes at once, streaming the image in parallel from source to destination a section at a time.  Because `ruby-vips` is parallel, it's quick, and because it doesn't need to keep entire images in memory, it's light.

This gem is a backwards compatible fork of `ruby-vips` but also includes (and compiles) the [libvips] source code.

[libvips]: https://libvips.github.io/libvips

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vips'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install vips

You'll still need to install `glib` and `gobject-introspection`.

## Usage

Exactly the same way as [ruby-vips].
